Actual question: _Please, briefly describe any activities you participate in or that you are passionate about in school and outside of school (e.g. hobbies, arts, community causes, activities or clubs, sport). How long have you been doing them?_


# My answer

I have got several passions, and now I am going to share some of these with you.

One of my really big passions is software design and computer programming. I mostly write in the PHP programming language, and most of my real meaningful projects are written in this language as well, like the Diggy's Helper Forum as well as the projects I plan to develop in the future, such as the RealHtmlDocument. I chose to introduce you specificifically to these two projects of mine for a reason. The Diggy's Helper Forum, or dh Forum as I call it internally, is an opensource discussion forum with its main instance running on the [diggyshelper.net](https://diggyshelper.net) website. This website is meant to be a czech&slovak discussion forum with its main topic being the online game Diggy's Adventure. (I have actually never played the game myself, but a friend of mine does, so we commenced the project about four yeas ago to help players go through the game. I do all of the hard job of programming and personally believe it needs just a bit more tuning to become great :-)

What about the RealHtmlDocument? One can say that since it is a future project and nowadays just a concept, there is not too much to talk about it. However, it is a plan to actually help thousands of PHP developers who work with HTML DOMs to feel more natively, as if they were working with a browser. Nowadays' native DOM tools in PHP do not work very well, at least from what I can tell, because they require a valid piece of HTML and also break down under certain circumstances. But, this does not always fit you, because you're not always working with a valid HTML. Thus I decided to write my own DOM HTML parser in PHP according to the Living Standard spec and opensource it for other developers to be able to benefit from it.

I am also fluent in HTML, JavaScript and in most aspects of CSS as well (although lacking the necessary aesthetic thinking). In relation to this I'd like to mention two projects once again: the website of [Zubná Ambulancia Strmý Vŕšok](http://zubnaambulancia.sk), the stomatologic ambulance of my friend's mother, and the PinnacleSeven Odoo ERP frontend. <!-- will continue if there is time for that -->

My other activities are listed below:

* ~~programming (Diggy's Helper, Web Zubná ambulancia Strmý Vŕšok, RealHtmlDocument)~~
* ~~programming languages (PHP&JavaScript mostly)~~
* language learning (Tamil, Esperanto, Español)
* conlanging (= creating languages) and mostly linguistics
* space&space exploration, astrophysics, rocket science
* the science and philosophy behind of life, death&consciousness
* passionate about getting esperanto to be the official language of the European Union and be the second language to every European making up the identity of a "European citizen"
* doing the "Convict Conditioning" bodyweight exercises and formerly had been doing a very interesting sport called the sprint canoeing
