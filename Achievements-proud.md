# My answer

* I kept our project (mine and friend of mine's) called the Diggy's Helper forum alive for actual four years now (and counting) although it isn't and wasn't easy to maintain the software powering it because the website itself intentionally doesn't generate any income and the software itself was not initially written by myself thus I had to get rid of the many security errors and rewrite most of the code into a more friendly and maintainable form
* I had gone on an experience&education student exchange to India and I fell in love with the country, especially my state Tamil Nadu, the culture and the local language, Tamil, which although I haven't managed to get really fluent in, I've managed to learn the writing system at least, and I still really badly seek to learn the language.
* internship at PinnacleSeven's India branch office for 3 months (doing with web frontend and Python, Node.js and such; generally working with Odoo ERP)
* teaching myself programming (via trial and error) for about 6 years now
* learning Esperanto to advanced speaker level in approximately a year
* understanding (bit by bit) things in space work, getting fully interested in astrophysics, all through Kerbal Space Program
