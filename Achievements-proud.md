# Achievements you are proud of

Actual question: _Please, briefly describe one or more of achievements that make you proud, either from school or any of the activities that you [mentioned above](Activities-passions.md)._


# My answer

* I managed to keep our project (mine and a friend of mine's) called the Diggy's Helper Forum alive for actual four years now (and counting) although it isn't and wasn't very easy to maintain the software powering it because the website itself intentionally doesn't generate any income and the software itself was not initially written by myself thus I had to get rid of the many security holes and rewrite most of the code into a more friendly and maintainable form, raising the performance as well
* I have had the honor of **being an ambassador of Slovakia in India** through [Rotary](https://www.rotary.org/), where I have spent my exchange year and fell in love with the country, especially with my state Tamil Nadu, with the culture and the local language Tamil, which although I haven't managed to get really fluent in, I've managed to learn the Tamil writing system, and I still really badly seek to learn the language
* I have completed an internship at [PinnacleSeven](http://pinnacleseven.com/)'s India branch office working there as an intern for three months (working with the web frontend and the Python backend, writing Node.js tools and managing a team consisting of a tester and another programmer; generally working with the Odoo opensource ERP software)
* Have been teaching (and taught) myself programming (via trial and error) for about six years now, you can see how good did I manage to get from my references listed in [README](README.md) and the [Activities and passions question](Activities-passions.md)
* Learning Esperanto the international language to an advanced speaker level in approximately a year
* Understanding (bit by bit) how the things in space work, getting fully interested in astrophysics, all mostly through the [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)
