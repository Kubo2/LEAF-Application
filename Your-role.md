# Your role in school or in your activities&hobbies

Actual question: _What is your role in school/outside of school activities or hobbies? Have you ever organized or initiated something?_


# My answer

I have organized:


## Train trips

A year ago (before my exchange) I had two times organized the train trips of ours so all of us the exchange students could travel together to the Rotary meetings prior to our exchanges.


## Failed moonshot

Right at the beginning of the winter 2016, I initiated an interesting project and succeeded in gathering together a team of clever, skillful and ambitious people from my own classmates and our school, including our computer science teacher and also getting a lot of support from our supportive classteacher. The matter was that, earlier back in India, I learned about a competition, a massive space competition to be precise, called the [Google Lunar X-Prize](http://lunar.xprize.org/).
Then, after rejoining my school in Slovakia, I recalled this competition after some discussion about space and physics with a friend of mine, and I suggested that we could maybe put together a team of people and win the first prize in the competition. :-) So I and the friend of mine, we made sure that the word was spread around in our class, making us both look crazy in the eyes of our classmates. Nevertheless, we continued our work on planning the lunar exploration mission, designing a rover and a skycrane lander. (I gave the skycrane and the rover their names from the slovak history: the skycrane would have been called 'Orol Tatranský' The Eagle of the Tatras and the rover would have been named 'Svätopluk 1', after the ruler of the Great Moravia.)

In a short time, some of our classmates got interested in the idea of landing a rover on the Moon and winning the prize, so they joined us. We all worked together for a considerable amount of time and have gathered considerable amounts of information about space travel and gained lots of experience with planning such a mission. After a while, we started to progress a little and we needed to get the private funding as stated on the X-Prize's website as well as some guidance from a more experienced individual than we ourselves were.

So I headed straight to one of my favorite teachers at our school, the computer science teacher, and talked to him about the project we were working on. He obviously got very interested about it and offered me to be our guide and supervisor (because his knowledge about the topic was much much greater than ours, and also because he's always very passionate about any out-of-ordinary students' activities), and what's more, he offered us that he would employ his whole team of computer-science-educated people (for his main job outside the school being a computer programmer) to help us with the project. I didn't ask him for it, but I was happy to accept this extraordinary offer from him as I appreciated it very much.

The general flaw of our great moonshot plan arose about a month afterwards, when we looked more closely at the competition because we wanted to actually sign up for it, and only then we realized it had already been in progress for few years, with a few teams already in the last round. Thus we realized our mistake and felt really embarassed about it, but I still think it was more than worth it, because we have acquired the knowledge we otherwise wouldn't and we also realized our own potentials as well as have discovered that the group of us who joined have the patience and belief to seek higher things.

And the motivation hadn't completely fainted either. At least in me and the friend of mine, with whom we had started this – we now aim to build the first slovak space agency which will actually send spacecrafts to space exploration missions, build rockets and launch them right from here in Slovakia. We want to give it the name 'Space Centre Záhorská Bystrica'.


## Future school in India

Along with my sister Karin, we want to found a private school in India which would be the same way affordable and great as the LEAF Academy is, so we actually want to get some inspiration from our studies at the LEAF Academy. (I am talking for us both because we have actually already discussed this with my sister and agreed that we'd found a network of three schools like this around the world, the first one in India, as I have already mentioned, then one in Brazil and the last but not least one in Slovakia. The main instruction language would probably be the language of the country in the first year or the first two years, and then onwards it'd be the international language Esperanto which the students would learn in the first two years as their second language; this would prepare them to learn any other world language from then onwards easily.)

My role in... the activities and hobbies:

I have learned through various psychological experiences of mine and through the feedback from my friends, family and other people, that I am a good strategic thinker. I can sometimes see the problems breaking in front of my eyes into pieces small enough so they are manageable easily, and I can set a priority to each of them and order them so that I manage to do them correctly; this applies mainly to my programming activities but also for example to this application because I treat it the same way I treat my code.
