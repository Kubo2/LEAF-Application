# Why do you want to join the LEAF Academy?

I am interested in joining the LEAF Academy for a few different reasons. At first, it offers a huge improvement to the traditional slovak education system – the concepts of a _high school_ and a _grammar school_. These two concepts are the only – or until recently were the only – options for high school education in Slovakia. However, they both are kind of edge cases, each on its own side of the road. If considered properly, one can clearly see that in the case of a traditional slovak _high school_, a student is forced to narrow their worldview and specialize in a certain few specific topics, almost leaving everything else out. Whereas, in the case of a traditional slovak _grammar school_, students usually don't learn anything too much useful during the four years of high school, at least nowadays, because teachers reduce the things we go through claiming the excuse that there's no time to do or learn that and that we would take that at the seminaries, despite the fact that there seems to be no time to take too much stuff at the seminaries either. A student studying at a traditional slovak _grammar school_ waits four or eight years like a chicory to finally learn something only to learn that he had learnt almost nothing beyond the general affairs.

Here comes the reason being a conclusion of the above: LEAF Academy looks to me like that kind of a school which bridges those two edge cases, residing essentially in the middle, leaving itself balanced. It is the ideal type of education where a student does not need to _specialize_ in something to _concentrate and focus_  on something through various extra-curricular activities that, according to its students, the school heavily supports; all while seeking the general curriculum knowledge as well.
The idea of it being also a _boarding high school_ makes it even more powerful, as the students should be able to connect and collaborate more closely with each other.

The ideas stated above are my main reason bundle for being so fond of joining the LEAF Academy and it is mostly also a reason why I love the LEAF Academy so much.

My another personal reason for joining the LEAF Academy is because it offers freedom in choosing your second language for graduation. Myself, at my current school, I had no choice of choosing my second and third language. I was forced to learn two languages: my second language for graduation, English, which I have progressively become to love throughout those 10 years for which I have been learning and _using_ it, as it became one of my needs as well (reading documentations and code, etc.), and German, my third language for... well, for nothing. Or better said, for the case I decide to make it my graduation language, which simply cannot happen, because if there's one language in the world that I physically don't like, it is German.
On the open day, I have heard that it is possible to chose any second language at the LEAF Academy if a student _really wants to_ learn it. I was really excited about it as I have also heard that there's already an open Spanish class, the language which I've been studying myself for a while now, as it is one of my _heart-close_ languages.
