# An interesting or funny fact about you

Actual question: _An interesting or funny fact about you:_


# My answer

One of the things which I consider funny about me is the fact that I cannot dance (I can't _feel the rhytm_) but strangely I still love to do it, I always try to get my dancing better and it brings me a great deal of joy if I can get my body movements synchronized and coordinated so the dance is actually a dance and not just a bunch of random body movements as is usual for me.
